    - New SimpleGroup driver provided by Mark Stosberg (See docs for usage)
    - Implemented the __USERNAME__ and __GROUP__ constraint variables
      in the DBI driver which were already documented in the examples
      given in the Authorization module docs 
    - the DBI driver was assuming that a USERNAME option was being passed
      in, which could result in an invalid SQL statement (Hugh Esco)

    - Lots of doc patches (Mark Stosberg)
    - Remove the DSN option in the DBI driver and suggest

      instead (Mark Stosberg)
